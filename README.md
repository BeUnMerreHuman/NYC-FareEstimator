# NYC-FareEstimator
This project implements a hybrid machine learning system to predict taxi fares using public New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) datasets.  By combining exploratory data analysis (EDA) with advanced modeling, the system distinguishes between deterministic business rules and stochastic, non-linear variables.
